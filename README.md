 # Differentiate between Statically typed and Dynamically typed programming languages and give examples of languages that fall under each category

 - A language is statically typed if the type of a variable is known at compile time. For some languages this means that you as the programmer must specify what type each variable is; other languages (e.g.: Java, C, C++).
 - A language is dynamically typed if the type is associated with run-time values, and not named variables/fields/etc. This means that you as a programmer can write a little quicker because you do not have to specify types every time (unless using a statically-typed language with type inference).
 # Differentiate between the JavaScript data types ‘null’ and ‘undefined&nbsp;

 - In JavaScript, undefined is a type, whereas null an object. It means a variable declared, but no value has been assigned a value. Whereas, null in JavaScript is an assignment value.
